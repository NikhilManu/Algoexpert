Course Schedule II [leetCode]
"""
"""
There are a total of n courses you have to take labelled from 0 to n - 1.
Some courses may have prerequisites, for example, if prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] this means you must take the course ai before the course bi.

Given the total number of courses numCourses and a list of the prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
If there are many valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

Input: numCourses = 4, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: [3, 1, 2, 0]

"""
Caesar Cipher Encryptor
Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer representing a key, write a function
that returns a new string obtained by shifting every letter in the input string by k positions in the alphabet,
where k is the key.
Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet;
in other words, the letter z shifted by one returns the  letter a.

Sample Input: "xyz", 2
Sample Output: "zab"
